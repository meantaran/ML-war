MLWARE Sherlock Files is a deep learning project that reconstructs the correct chronological order of shuffled video frames. Using CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for temporal modeling, the system learns motion patterns and predicts frame rankings to restore the true sequence of events in videos.



MLWARE Sherlock Files
Reconstructing the True Timeline of Motion using Deep Learning

MLWARE Sherlock Files is an AI-powered system designed to reconstruct the correct chronological order of shuffled video frames using computer vision and deep learning. The project analyzes motion dynamics and visual patterns in video frames to restore the original sequence of events.

The system mimics the reasoning of a forensic investigator by identifying temporal relationships between frames and learning how objects move according to physical laws.

This project was developed as part of the MLWARE competition at TECHNEX'26, where participants build machine learning models capable of solving complex temporal reconstruction problems.

Problem Statement

In many real-world scenarios, video data may become corrupted or fragmented, causing frames to lose their correct chronological order.

The objective of this project is to build a deep learning model that predicts the correct ordering of frames in a shuffled video sequence.

Each video contains motion-based interactions such as:

Objects falling

Collisions

Sliding motion

Physical interactions

By analyzing spatial features and temporal relationships between frames, the model reconstructs the correct timeline.

Model Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

CNN Feature Extractor

A pretrained CNN model (ResNet50) is used to extract spatial features from each frame.

Temporal Sequence Model

An LSTM network analyzes the sequence of frame features to learn motion patterns and predict temporal relationships.

The model outputs a ranking score for each frame, which is then sorted to reconstruct the correct order.

Evaluation Metric

The model performance is evaluated using Kendall Rank Correlation (Kendall's Tau).

This metric measures how closely the predicted frame order matches the true chronological sequence.

Score Range:

1 → Perfect ordering

0 → Random ordering

-1 → Completely incorrect ordering
